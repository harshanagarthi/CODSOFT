So finally we got the results as :<br>
    Through logistic regression model we got 96% accuracy which means so good.<br>
    Through Support Vector Machine model we got 98% accuracy, it can be a most considerable.<br>
    Through Random Forest model we got 98% accuracy.<br>
    
    So, we can conclude that all the models used can be best suitable (>95%)
